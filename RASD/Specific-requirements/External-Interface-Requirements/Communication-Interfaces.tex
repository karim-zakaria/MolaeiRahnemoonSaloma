As previously mentioned, the system uses the interfaces provided by the municipality to perform some of the main functions. The interfaces accessed by the system are as follows; firstly, an interface provided by the authorities for the retrieval of accident data. Said interface is used in order to couple the accident data with \emph{SafeStreets} report data in order to decide upon appropriate interventions in order to decrease violation leading to accidents. To communicate the interventions along with other data to the authorities; specifically, details of aggregated reports and refined report data inferring some insights the system uses a second interface offered by the municipality for the submission of such data. Other than the municipality's interfaces all communication interfaces used by the system are internal interfaces used by the diverse system sub-modules in order to interact. Finally, it is noteworthy to mention that if the system is not provided the interfaces by the municipality it is impossible to communicate any of the previously mentioned data, since it is assumed that the system shall exploit the authority provided communication service to proactively provide this data.

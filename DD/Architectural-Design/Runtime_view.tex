\subsection{Runtime View}
This section of the document is concerned with the dynamic interactions between the various components of the system during runtime to achieve the desired functions of the system. The section is constituted of four major subsections grouping together various runtime views of different parts of the system. These subsections are as follows \emph{general functions, violation reports, view safety} and \emph{municipality interaction}. In the following diagrams some simplifications were implemented in order to remove redundant details; however, they should still be mentioned, such as, that each and every server module interaction should correspond to a \emph{log entry}, and all exceptions that may occur in the system should be error logged. Note that in the diagrams, some examples are used for logging and error logging interactions. Moreover, it is noteworthy that all external incoming and outgoing data passes through the \emph{Security module} encryption and decryption and the same process occurs on the mobile app.

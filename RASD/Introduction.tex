\subsubsection{General Purpose}
Nowadays, an ever-increasing number of cars and a shortage in the number of police officers caused the emergence of various traffic violations and accidents. Although two traditional solutions to solve these problems were rising the number of police officers and their equipment, due to the poor efficiency and inordinate cost, it is not feasible to continue this trend. This is where the power of technology can take the responsibility to help authorities to bring the order to the streets.

The only solution to assist authorities without expanding budgets is to participate in people with an intuitive and simple method. Hence, the "SafeStreet" app is proposed, which provides the possibility of reporting traffic violations and accidents by taking advantage of crowed-sourcing. Users can report violations by just taking pictures of infringement and license plate, then sending them.

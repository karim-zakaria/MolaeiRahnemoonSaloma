\section{Requirements Traceability}
This section shall present a traceability matrix to ensure the satisfaction of all functional requirements and therefore the satisfaction of the underlying goals which are expected of the system. The \emph{Requirements traceability matrix(RTM)} presented below shows a correlation between all the functional requirements previously defined in the \emph{RASD} document and the system modules that satisfy and perform these functionalities. Apart from the components mention in the \emph{RTM} some other components were defined in previous sections; though these modules are not direct contributors to the realization of the requirements they do however perform some roles ensuring the smooth and secure operating of the system as a whole.

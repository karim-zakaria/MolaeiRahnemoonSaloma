A system constituted of multiple smaller subsystems, such as, the \emph{SafeStreets} system should developed with the aspect of \emph{maintainability} in mind. A modular approach for the different services and the interaction with external interfaces would be the most suitable approach for a system with such characteristics. Employing such an approach would make the process of diagnosing failures and fixing them much less complex. Therefore, increasing the measure of \emph{maintainability} of the system.

\emph{\textbf{Scenario}}

Lorenzo is a student who is living in Rome. During the summer, he decides to go on a trip to Milan. Due to the fact that Milan is a really crowded city and number of accidents and traffic violations have skyrocketed in the recent decade, he is skeptical to drive his personal car to enjoy the eye-catching scenery along the way or book a flight. His friend suggests to use the SafeStreets app to check the safety of the area he will be staying in Milan in order to decide whether it would be safe to leave his car behind and move on foot there. He opens the app searches for the area his hotel is in and views the safety of nearby streets.

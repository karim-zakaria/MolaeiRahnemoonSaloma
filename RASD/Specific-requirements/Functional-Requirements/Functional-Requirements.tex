\subsection{Requirements}

\textbf{\goal{1}}
\begin{itemize}
\require Users should be allowed to register to services provided by the system
\require Users should provide unique identification to the such as fiscal code during registration
\require Registered users should be allowed to login
\require Each registered user should have a unique username used for logging in chosen at registration time
\require System should enable registered users to report traffic violations
\require When reporting a violation, users should be able to take an image of the violating vehicle’s license plate
\require When reporting a violation, users should be able to fill in the details of the reported violation such as the type of the violation
\require The system should be able to detect the current user location when reporting a violation
\require The system should extract the plate numbers from the image taken by the user
\require The received reports must be stored by the system to be used by other services 
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\domain User provided image of traffic violations is not tampered with physically
\domain User location included in report assumed to be the true unmodified location
\domain Each plate number is unique and registered to only one vehicle

\textbf{\goal{2}}

\begin{itemize}

\require Registered users should be allowed to view a representation of the safety of selected areas possibly with the help of a map API
\require The system should implement a means to measure the safety of various areas based on reported violations in said areas
\require Incoming reports should be integrated and used to update the safety of areas 
\require If accident reports are provided by authorities the system should take that data into account when calculating the safety of a certain area

\end{itemize}

\require The system should be able to decide on appropriate interventions to minimize frequent traffic violations in the various areas
\require The system should formalize the interventions to be suggested in a form acceptable by the municipality interface
\require The system should submit the interventions regarding the areas with high frequency of violations to the municipality interface
\require The system has to be able to mine reports to find insights based on types of violation and different areas
\require The system should be able to recommend possible interventions to authorities in order to prevent violation
\require The recommendations has to be prioritized based on the entity od authority
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}

\domain User devices used for reporting violations has functioning a camera and GPS

\end{itemize}

\textbf{\goal{5}}

\begin{itemize}

\require The system should analyze the data from the reports to produce statistics such as the most frequent plate numbers that commit violations

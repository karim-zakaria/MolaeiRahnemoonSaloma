\subsubsection{General Functions}
This first subsection considers the runtime behavior of system components for the delivery of basic general functions. Specifically, \emph{registration and verification, login} and \emph{profile viewing and info editing}. The first two runtime diagrams below describe the user registration and verification process. As can be seen in the diagram a new user fills in the registration form with his information the submits the form. The data is relayed to the \emph{Safestreets-API} which saves the user data and prompts the \emph{Firebase-Authentication} server to verify the new user. Which in turn, sends the verification message to the user and returns feedback of the user confirmation.

The below figure describes the user login process. Which again, relies on the \emph{Firebase-Authentication} server to authenticate the user credentials and issuing a token to be sent to the app server to confirm the authentication process.

The last of the general functions in the figure below is the \emph{ViewMe} functionality. Where the user can view their profile and edit their personal information.

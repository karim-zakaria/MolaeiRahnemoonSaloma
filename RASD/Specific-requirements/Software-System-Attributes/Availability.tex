As the case was for the \emph{reliability} aspect of the system; \emph{availability} is more of a general requirement to provide an acceptable quality of system; rather than, it being a critical requirement of the system. Therefore, it is sufficient for the system to have \emph{3-nines availability}; i.e., be available \emph{99.9\%} of the time. This would provide balance between providing an acceptable quality of service and the increased system complexity needed to have higher \emph{availability}.

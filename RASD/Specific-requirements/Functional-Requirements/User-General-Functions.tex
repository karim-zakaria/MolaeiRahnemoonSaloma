\subsection{Registration}

\emph{\textbf{Scenario}}

Amirsalar is a good boy and always tries to obey all the rules; whenever he saw a person who violates the rule especially those which related to traffic, he becomes upset if that person goes away without any ticket. One day, he heard from his best friend Karim that there is a new app called "SafeStreet"; which people could send traffic violations to the authorities so they could ticket all the violator. His friend continued beside this amazing feature app also give some information about the safety of the different zones of the city. Amirsalar excited about the app because he suddenly felt he is useful for society and also the app provides useful information for the new persons in a big city like Milan because he is a foreign freshman student. Therefore he goes on his phone app store and installs the app. Then he fills up all the required fields in the registration form. Then he stays for the verification of his account by SMS and Email.

\subsection{Login}

\emph{\textbf{Scenario}}
After Amirsalar's account is verified, he goes to login in the app, so he entered his credentials for login and checked the box which keeps the Amirsalar in his account for 3 months to he can report violation faster without every time login in the software.

\subsection{Give Permission}

\emph{\textbf{Scenario}}

Bob has finished the registration process for the SafeStreets app and has logged in for the first time he gets a message from the app asking permission to access his mobile phone camera; he accepts.

\subsection{Overview}
The high-level architecture of the system to be developed is illustrated below, which gives abstract information about different parts of the system. For the backend part, the system uses a VPS which is hosted on Hetzner company, renting VPS provides the possibility of avoiding problems related to managing server’s hardware and configuration. Furthermore, in order to guarantee the flexibility and scalability of the system for the future, we use \emph{Kubernetes} which is an open-source container-orchestration system, it allows us to maintain and manage containers in real-time. Moreover, for development and deployment environment, we use \emph{Docker} containers  for implementing microservice architectures that will be elaborated in detail in the following sections. In this case, all services can operate independently. \\
What is more, for logging and error tracking both in frontend and backend, SafeStreet takes advantage of \emph{Sentry} which is a monitoring service application that allows us to track chaotic and inevitable errors in the SafeStreet system. Apart from this, \emph{Datadog} which is a monitoring service for applications is used for VPS monitoring, aiming to display relevant information of the VPS in real-time through a user-friendly and professional dashboard. \\
As a reliable geo-location service, the system uses the \emph{GoogleMap API} that provides rich functionality for our system. When it comes to security, the system utilizes \emph{Cloudflare’s} CDN, DNS/DNSSEC, Firewall, Rate limiting, Load balancing and SSL/TLS to ensure data confidentiality and integration. Additionally, for the aim of authentication and storage \emph{Firebase} is used, because of its simplicity that helps developers to implement their application.
